This Software is an eCAP adapter for HTTP compression with GZIP.

The adapter is installed in /usr/local/lib/ by default.

The libecap library is required to build and use these adapters. You can get
the library from http://www.e-cap.org/. The adapter can be built and
installed from source, usually by running:

    % ./configure
    % make
    % make install
